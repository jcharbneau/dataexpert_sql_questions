26-*Identifying Active Businesses Based on Event Occurrences
 
Using the playground.business_events table, identify all active businesses. An active business is defined as one that has more than one event type with occurrences greater than the average occurrences of that event type among all businesses. The goal is to filter businesses based on their activity level, comparing individual event occurrences to the overall average for those event types. The result should be a table with one column called business_id with all the business ids that are active.


-- SELECT * FROM playground.business_events LIMIT 100

-- cte for average occurences by event_type
with event_type_averages as (
  select 
    event_type,
    avg(occurences) as avg_occurences
  from playground.business_events
  group by event_type
),
-- cte to identify business above avg
business_above_average as (
  select
    be.business_id,
    be.event_type
  from
    playground.business_events be
  join
    event_type_averages eta on be.event_type = eta.event_type
  where
    be.occurences > eta.avg_occurences
),
-- cte to identify businesses with more than one 
--  event_type w/ occurences > avg
active_businesses as (
  select
    business_id,
    count(*) as event_type_count
  from
    business_above_average
  group by
    business_id
  having count(*) > 1

)

-- select * from business_above_average

select 
  business_id
from
  active_businesses
