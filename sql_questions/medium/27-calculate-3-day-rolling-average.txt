27-*Calculate 3-Day Rolling Average of Posts per User
 
Using the table playground.posts, write a SQL query to calculate the 3-day rolling average of posts for each user. The output should include columns: user_id, post_date, and third_rolling_avg, where third_rolling_avg is the 3-day rolling average of post count for each user, rounded to 2 decimal places. The rolling average should be calculated over a specified 3-day period for each user, including the current day and the two preceding days. The result should be ordered in ascending order of post date

-- SELECT * FROM playground.posts LIMIT 100

select 
  user_id,
  post_date,
  -- post_count,
  round(avg(post_count) over(
    partition by user_id
    order by post_date
    rows between 2 preceding and current row
  ),2) as third_rolling_avg
from
  playground.posts
order by 
  user_id asc,
  post_date asc
