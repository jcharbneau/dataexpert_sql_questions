21-*Filtering Dance Contest Scores
 
Given a table playground.dance_scores (columns: arbiter_id, first_criterion, second_criterion, third_criterion) with scores from 1 to 10 awarded by judges in a dance contest, write a query to exclude scores from any judge who awarded an extreme score (either minimum or maximum) for at least two criteria. Return the filtered scores, sorted by arbiter_id.
