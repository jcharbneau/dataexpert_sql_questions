22-*Finding Actors by Favorite Movie Genre
 
Given three tables - playground.movies, playground.starring_actors, and playground.actor_ages - identify actors from the most common movie genre in your library. Assume each actor is listed once representing their best role. The task is to list actors with their age, sorted from oldest to youngest, who star in movies of your favorite genre (the most common genre in your list). In case of actors being the same age, sort them by name.The resultant table should have two columns, actor and age.


-- SELECT * FROM playground.movies LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.starring_actors LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.actor_ages LIMIT 100

-- find our favorite genre
-- make it a cte
with most_common_genre as (
  select genre 
  from playground.movies
  group by genre
  order by count(*) desc
  limit 1
),
-- get the actors from our most common genre (aka fav)
actors_in_favorite_genre as (
  select sa.actor
  from playground.starring_actors sa
  join playground.movies m on sa.movie_name = m.movie
  where m.genre = (select genre from most_common_genre)
),
-- get the ages of the actors
actor_ages as (
  select 
    aa.actor,
    aa.age
  from playground.actor_ages aa
  -- join from above
  join actors_in_favorite_genre afg on afg.actor = aa.actor
  
)

-- select * from ActorsInFavGenre
