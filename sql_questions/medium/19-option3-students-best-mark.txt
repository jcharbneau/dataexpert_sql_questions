19-Identifying students with the best grade
 
Using the playground.marks table, write a SQL query to determine the students who achieved the highest marks when graded according to Option 3, where the final exam accounts for 100% of the grade. The other grading options are provided for context: Option 1: Midterm 1 contributes 25%, Midterm 2 contributes 25%, and the Final exam contributes 50% of the grade. Option 2: Midterm 1 contributes 50% and Midterm 2 contributes 50% of the grade. Option 3: The Final exam contributes 100% of the grade. The output should be sorted by the students' names in ascending order. Ensure the column names in the result are displayed in lowercase. The resultant table should have two columns, name and their id.
These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.marks
Name string
ID int
Midterm1 int
Midterm2 int
Final int

Your answer should include these columns:
name varchar
id integer

step 1
ok, so lets take a look at getting the initial data we need to review - we'll start by querying name, id, midterm1, midterm2 and final

    select 
        name, 
        id, 
        midterm1, 
        midterm2, 
        final
    from academy.playground.marks

step 2
	ok, so lets drill into the requirement we want to identify the students with the highest marks when graded with option 3 (final = 100% of grade) - in order to do that, we first need to understand the scores for all options.

	lets step through this:
	Option 1: Midterm 1 contributes 25%, Midterm 2 contributes 25%, and the Final exam contributes 50% of the grade.
	or: 
		midterm1 * 0.25 + midterm2 * 0.25 + final * 0.5

	Option 2: Midterm 1 contributes 50% and Midterm 2 contributes 50% of the grade.
	or:
		midterm1 * 0.5 + midterm2 * 0.5

	Option 3: The Final exam contributes 100% of the grade.
	or:
		final 

	  select 
        name, 
        id, 
        midterm1, 
        midterm2, 
        final,
        (midterm1 * 0.25 + midterm2 * 0.25 + final * 0.5) AS grade_option1,
        (midterm1 * 0.5 + midterm2 * 0.5) AS grade_option2,
        final AS grade_option3 -- optional
    from academy.playground.marks

step 3
	ok, so now we're getting our various grade options, lets step that out

	with calculated_grades as (
	  select 
        name, 
        id, 
        midterm1, 
        midterm2, 
        final,
        (midterm1 * 0.25 + midterm2 * 0.25 + final * 0.5) AS grade_option1,
        (midterm1 * 0.5 + midterm2 * 0.5) AS grade_option2,
        final AS grade_option3 -- optional
      from academy.playground.marks
	)

	select * from calculated_grades


step 4
	finally, lets retrieve the data from the calculated_graphs cte and perform our conditionals, 
	lets make sure to sort by the students name in ascending order


	with calculated_grades as (
	  select 
        name, 
        id, 
        midterm1, 
        midterm2, 
        final,
        (midterm1 * 0.25 + midterm2 * 0.25 + final * 0.5) AS grade_option1,
        (midterm1 * 0.5 + midterm2 * 0.5) AS grade_option2,
        final AS grade_option3 -- optional
      from academy.playground.marks
	)

	select
		name,
		id,
		grade_option1,
		grade_option2,
		grade_option3
	from
		calculated_grades
	where
		grade_option3 > grade_option1
		and grade_option3 > grade_option2
	order by
		name asc
