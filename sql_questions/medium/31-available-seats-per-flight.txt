31-*Calculating Available Seats on Flights
 
Calculate the number of seats not yet purchased for each flight. Use three tables: playground.flights (with columns: flight_id, plane_id), playground.planes (with columns: plane_id, number_of_seats), and playground.purchases (with columns: flight_id, seat_no). Each row in purchases is unique for (flight_id, seat_no) pairs. For each flight_id, compute the free_seats as the number of seats not purchased. Order the results by flight_id in ascending order. Ensure consistency in purchases, with no records for non-existing flight_ids or seat_nos.
These are the tables for this question:
playground.flights
playground.planes
playground.purchases


-- SELECT * FROM playground.flights LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.planes LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.purchases LIMIT 100

-- select count(*) from playground.purchases pu where pu.flight_id = 87

select
  f.flight_id,
  -- p.number_of_seats,
  p.number_of_seats - coalesce((select count(*) from playground.purchases pu where pu.flight_id = f.flight_id),0) as free_seats
from playground.flights f
join playground.planes p on f.plane_id = p.plane_id
group by 
  f.flight_id, p.number_of_seats
order by
  f.flight_id asc
