23-*Finding Highest Grade and Corresponding Course per Student
 
Using the table playground.student_grades, write a SQL query to find the highest grade and its corresponding course for each student. In cases where there is a tie for the highest grade, select the course with the smallest course_id. The output should include student_id, course_id, and the grade, with the results sorted by increasing student_id.


-- SELECT * FROM playground.student_grades LIMIT 100

with rankedGrades as (
  select 
    student_id,
    course_id,
    grade,
    -- rank each grade for each student
    row_number() over (
      -- partition the rank by student
      partition by student_id    
    
      order by grade desc, course_id asc
    ) as rank
  from playground.student_grades
)

select 
  student_id,
  course_id,
  grade
from
  rankedGrades  
where 
  rank = 1
order by 
  student_id asc
