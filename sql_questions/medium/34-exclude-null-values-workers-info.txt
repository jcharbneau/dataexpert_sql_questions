34-*Transform workers_info Table to Exclude NULL Values
 
Given a table named playground.workers_info, write a SQL query to transform this table. The transformation should result in a table with three columns: id, column_name, and value, where column_name is the name of the original column containing a non-NULL value for each id, and value is the stringified non-NULL value from this column. Exclude rows where the original value is NULL. The result should be sorted by id in ascending order, and for rows with the same id, sorted by column_name in ascending order.


-- SELECT * FROM playground.workers_info LIMIT 100




select 
  id, 
  'name' as column_name, 
  cast(name as varchar) as value
from 
  playground.workers_info
where name is not null

union all

select 
  id,
  'date_of_birth' as column_name,
  cast(date_of_birth as varchar) as value
from
  playground.workers_info
where date_of_birth is not null

union all

select
  id,
  'salary' as column_name, 
  cast(salary as varchar) as value
from 
  playground.workers_info
where 
  salary is not null
  
order by 
  id asc, 
  column_name asc
