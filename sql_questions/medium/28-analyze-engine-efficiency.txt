28-*Analyze Engine Efficiency by Fuel Type
 
Using the table playground.automobile, write a SQL query to analyze engine efficiency by comparing the average city mileage to highway mileage for each fuel type. The efficiency ratio is defined as the average highway mileage divided by the average city mileage. Include fuel type, average city mileage, average highway mileage, and efficiency ratio in the results, rounded up to 2 decimal places, ordered by the highest efficiency ratio.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.automobile
brand_name string
fuel_type string
aspiration string
door_panel string
design string
wheel_drive string
engine_location string
engine_type string
cylinder_count string
engine_size int
fuel_system string
bore double
stroke double
compression_ratio double
horse_power int
top_RPM int
city_mileage int
highway_mileage int
price_in_dollars int

Your answer should include these columns:
fuel_type varchar
avg_city_mileage double
avg_highway_mileage double
efficiency_ratio double
