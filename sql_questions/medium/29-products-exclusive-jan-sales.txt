29-*Identify Products Sold Exclusively in January 2024
 
Using the tables playground.products and playground.product_sales, write a SQL query to find products that were sold exclusively within the month of January 2024 (from "2024-01-01" to "2024-01-31", inclusive). The output should include the product_id and product_name for each qualifying product.


-- SELECT * FROM playground.products LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.product_sales LIMIT 100


select distinct p.product_id, p.product_name 
from playground.product_sales s
join playground.products p on s.product_id = p.product_id
where date(s.sale_date) between date '2024-01-01' and date '2024-01-31'
and not exists (
  select 1 
  from playground.product_sales s2
  where s2.product_id = s.product_id
  and  (date(s2.sale_date) < date '2024-01-01'
    or date(s2.sale_date) > date '2024-01-31')
)
