24-*Summarizing Foreign Competitors by Country with Total Summary
 
Given the playground.foreign_competitors table with columns: competitor and country, write a SQL query to calculate the number of competitors per country. Additionally, include a final summary row that shows "Total:" and the total number of competitors. The resulting table should have two columns: country and competitors, sorted by competitors and country names in ascending order, and include the summary row at the bottom.
These are the tables for this question:
playground.foreign_competitors


-- SELECT * FROM playground.foreign_competitors LIMIT 100


select country, competitors from (
  select country, count(*) as competitors
  from playground.foreign_competitors
  group by country
  union all
  select 'Total:' as country, count(*) as competitors
  from playground.foreign_competitors
) as results

order by 
  case when country = 'Total:' then 1 else 0 end,
  competitors asc,
  country asc
