18-*Comparing State Fatal Collisions to the National Average
 
Using playground.bad_drivers, write a SQL query to compare each stateâ€™s fatal collisions per billion miles to the national average. Include a column that indicates whether the state is "Above Average" or "Below Average". The resultant table should have three columns, "state", "fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles" and "comparison_to_national_avg". Show the result ordered by state name asc.

SELECT * FROM playground.bad_drivers LIMIT 100


with national_average as (
  select avg(fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles) as avg_fatal_collisions
  from playground.bad_drivers
)

select
  state,
  fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles
  case
    when fatal_collisions_per_billion_miles > (select avg_fatal_collisions from national_average) then 'Above Average'
    else 'Below Average'
  end as comparison_to_national_avg
from playground.bad_drivers
order by state asc
