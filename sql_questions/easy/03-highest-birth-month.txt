03-Month with the Highest Total Births


Determine the month with the highest total number of births in the playground.us_birth_stats table. The output should show the month and the total number of births.
These are the tables for this question:

SELECT * FROM playground.us_birth_stats LIMIT 100

describe playground.us_birth_stats

select month, sum(births) as total_births
from playground.us_birth_stats
group by month
order by total_births desc
limit 1

step 1
  query for each month and births

  select 
  	month,
  	births
  from
  	playground.us_birth_stats


step 2
 next, lets also sum all births that match that month into a new column called total_births, note as we're using
 a sum() aggregation, we'll also need to include a group by (month)

   select 
  	month,
  	sum(births) as total_births
  from
  	playground.us_birth_stats

  group by
  	month


step 3
  lets clean it up a little further and make sure we return in the proper order as requested
