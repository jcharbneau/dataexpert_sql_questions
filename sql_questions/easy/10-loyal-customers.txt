Write a SQL query to display all loyal customers from the playground.superstore table. A customer is considered loyal if they have placed more than 20 orders. The query should return the customer ID, customer name, and the total number of orders for each of these customers. Display the result in descending order of their orders and then ascending order of their names

  customer_name,
  count(order_id) as order_count
from

step 1

 lets start by getting our basic details 

 select
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    order_id
from
    playground.superstore


step 2
    lets zero in on the "a customer is considered loyal" statement
    it says if they have placed more than 20 orders then we consider them loyal
    - so we need to first capture a count of orders for each customer (id & name)
    - note the group by


    first thing, lets get the order count
    select
        customer_id,
        customer_name,
        count(order_id) as order_count
    from
        playground.superstore
    group by
        customer_id,
        customer_name

step 3
    so now we see that we have data, formatted that way we need it and containing a order count
    grouped by customer id & name - lets go back to our requirement statement
    "A customer is considered loyal if they have placed more than 20 orders." 

    so now we determine the customers that have greater "more" than 20
    - note "where" does not allow aggregates

    select
        customer_id,
        customer_name,
        count(order_id) as order_count
    from
        playground.superstore
    group by
        customer_id,
        customer_name
    having count(order_id) > 20


step 4
    ok, so we're looking good but we're missing one final requirement
    - note hint "Data Mismatch for row 1"

    so our final requirement states:
     Display the result in descending order of their orders and then ascending order of their names

     lets do that now


    select 
      customer_id,
      customer_name,
      count(order_id) as order_count
    from
      playground.superstore
    group by 
      customer_id,
      customer_name
    having 
      count(order_id) > 20
    order by
      order_count desc,
      customer_name asc
