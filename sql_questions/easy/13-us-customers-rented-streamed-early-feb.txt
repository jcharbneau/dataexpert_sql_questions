13-Find US Customers Who Rented and Streamed Videos in Early February
 
Write a SQL query to return the US customers who rented a video on February 1st, 2023, and then streamed the same video between February 2nd and February 8th, 2023. Use the tables playground.rental for rental data and playground.streams for streaming data. The output should include unique user IDs of these customers ordered in ascending order.

SELECT * FROM playground.rental LIMIT 100


SELECT * FROM playground.streams LIMIT 100


-- SELECT * FROM playground.rental LIMIT 100

-- SELECT * FROM playground.streams LIMIT 100

select
  r.user_id,
  r.rental_date,
  s.stream_date,
  r.country
from
  playground.rental r
inner join playground.streams s on
  r.rental_id = s.rental_id
  -- limited dataset, but we need to filter on both
  --   consider cases where multiple users stream from same rental
  --
  and r.user_id = s.user_id
where
 -- filter on US country
  r.country = 'US'
 -- rental date of 2023-02-01
 and date(r.rental_date) = date '2023-02-01'
 -- limited dataset, but per requirement, need to filter on streaming dates between 02/02 and 02/08
 and date(s.stream_date) between date '2023-02-02' and date '2023-02-08'
 order by r.user_id asc

lets take a look at our tables


step 1
 ok, so lets start by getting our users, their rental date, and their country
 select
  user_id,
  rental_date,
  country
 from
  playground.rental


step 2
so looking at our requirements, a couple things stand out
- we need to filter on the country from the rentals table
- and we also want to filter on the date
- but we're missing our stream date from the requirements, so lets 
  start by including a join - since we want all the rows that match 
  from both sides that satisfy the join conidition, we'll do a inner join

select
  r.user_id,
  r.rental_date,
  r.country,
  s.stream_date
from
  playground.rental r
inner join playground.streams s on
  r.rental_id = s.rental_id
  
-***
  and r.user_id = s.user_id

  -- additional discussion
  -- limited dataset, but we need to filter on both
  --   consider cases where multiple users stream from 
  --   same rental or other similar scenario's



step 3
  ok, so now we're getting our data from both tables in the shape we need
  but, 
  we're still getting data from multiple countries
  we're still not filtering by our rental date,
  and we still need to determine videos that where
  streamed during our defined window

  lets add those pieces now

  note the use of the date() function, and date literal (which specifies the "type" of the data we're providing)


-- SELECT * FROM playground.rental LIMIT 100

-- SELECT * FROM playground.streams LIMIT 100

select
  r.user_id,
  r.rental_date,
  s.stream_date,
  r.country
from
  playground.rental r
inner join playground.streams s on
  r.rental_id = s.rental_id
  and r.user_id = s.user_id
where
  r.country = 'US'
 and date(r.rental_date) = date '2023-02-01'
 and date(s.stream_date) between date '2023-02-02' and date '2023-02-08'


order by r.user_id asc

 -- we can test the filter by changing the end date
 --
 --  and date(s.stream_date) between date '2023-02-02' and date '2023-02-04'
