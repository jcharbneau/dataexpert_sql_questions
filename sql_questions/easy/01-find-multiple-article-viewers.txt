01-Find Viewers with Multiple Article Views in a Day
 
Using the table playground.views, write a SQL query to identify all viewers who viewed more than one article on the same day. The table includes columns viewer_id (the ID of the viewer), article_id (the ID of the article viewed), and view_date (the date of the view). The result should contain a single column named viewer_id, listing each viewer who meets the criteria without duplicates, and should be sorted in ascending order of viewer_id.

SELECT * FROM playground.views LIMIT 100


select viewer_id from(
  select
    viewer_id,
    view_date,
    COUNT(distinct article_id) as articles_viewed
    from playground.views
    group by viewer_id, view_date
) as subquery
where articles_viewed > 1
order by viewer_id asc






step 1
  get a listing of viewers, view_date and articles

  select viewer_id, view_date, article_id from playground.views

step 2
  lets filter this further, by getting a count of articles
  - note we now need to group the results, in this case we will group by viewer and date
  select viewer_id, view_date, count(distinct article_id) as articles_viewed
  from playground.views grorup by viewer_id, view_date

step 3
  - convert this to a subquery, allowing us to filter by views > 1 and sort by viewer_id
