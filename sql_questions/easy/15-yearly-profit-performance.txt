Write a SQL query to analyze the profit performance of the company throughout the years using the playground.superstore table. Ensure to convert profit from varchar to a suitable numeric type for aggregation. The output should include the year extracted from the order_date, the total annual profit (total_profit) rounded to two decimal places, and should be ordered by year in descending order.

SELECT * FROM playground.superstore LIMIT 100

select 
    extract(year from order_date) as order_year,
    round(
      sum(
        cast(profit as decimal(10,2))
      ),
      2
    ) as total_profit
from playground.superstore
group by 
    extract(year from order_date)
order by
  order_year desc

so lets start by taking a look at the data

step 1
ok, we can begin by querying just the data we need

select
  order_date,
  profit
from
  playground.superstore


step 2
so we can see that we have a mixture of negative, positive values and that
some of them use a decimal, some of them do not, and others only have one 
digit to the right of the period  - lets correct that issue
select
  order_date,
  cast(profit as decimal(10,2))
  
from
  playground.superstore

next, we know that we are being asked to calculate the total profit by year
we can achieve this by extracting the year value from the order date, and also 
introducing a sum function to get our total profit, but then als

select 
    extract(year from order_date) as order_year,
    sum(
        cast(profit as decimal(10,2))
    ) as total_profit
from playground.superstore

-- generates error due to missing group by

select 
    extract(year from order_date) as order_year,
    sum(
        cast(profit as decimal(10,2))
    ) as total_profit
from playground.superstore
group by 
  extract(year from order_date)
