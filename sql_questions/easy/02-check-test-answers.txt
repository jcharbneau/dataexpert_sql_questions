02-Check Test Answers
 
Create a SQL query to evaluate test answers stored in a table named playground.answers with columns id (unique question ID), correct_answer (string), and given_answer (which can be NULL). Return a table with columns id and checks, where checks is "no answer" if given_answer is NULL, "correct" if given_answer matches correct_answer, and "incorrect" otherwise. Order the results by id.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.answers
id int
correct_answer string
given_answer string

Your answer should include these columns:
id integer
checks varchar



select 
  id,
  case
    when given_answer is null then 'no answer'
    when given_answer = correct_answer then 'correct'
    else 'incorrect'
  end as checks
from
  playground.answers
order by id




step 1
  
  in this case, we need to identify the questions and whether the given_answers were correct or not, we do this by
  returning 'no answer', 'correct', or 'incorrect' as part of our "checks" return column

  lets start by getting our id's
  select id from playground.answers


step 2
  lets introduce a case statement - this will allow us to return the appropriate values using a comparison operator
  to test the state of the given_answer column (row by row)

  select 
  	id,
  	case
  		when given_answer is null then 'no answer'

  	end as checks
  from 
  	playground.answers


  lets augment our case statement a little further by incorporating another check and an else statement
  when given_answer is null, we return 'no answer'
  when given_ansewer is equal to correct_answer then we return 'correct'
  otherwise, we return 'incorrect'
  
  select
  	id,
  	case
  		when given_answer is null then 'no answer'
  		when given_answer = correct_answer then 'correct'
		else 'incorrect'
	end as checks
  from playground.answers



step 4
  lets not forget our sort order
  select
  	id,
  	case
  		when given_answer is null then 'no answer'
  		when given_answer = correct_answer then 'correct'
		else 'incorrect'
	end as checks
  from playground.answers
  order by id asc
