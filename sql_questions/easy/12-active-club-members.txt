Given tables clubs (id: unique club id, name: club name) and students (id: unique student id, name: student name, club_id: club's id), return a list from the students table for those who are in clubs that still exist in the clubs table. The result should be sorted by students' ids and include only those students whose club_id matches an id in the clubs table.
