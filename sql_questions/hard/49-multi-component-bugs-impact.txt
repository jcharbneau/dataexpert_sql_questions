49-***Identifying Multi-Component Bugs and Their Impact
 
Analyze the playground.bug, playground.component, and playground.bug_component tables to identify bugs affecting multiple components. Bug table contains num (unique bug number) and title (bug title). Component table includes id (unique component id) and title (component title). BugComponent table links bugs to components with bug_num (references Bug.num) and component_id (references Component.id). The task is to list each bug (that affects more than one component) with the titles of affected components and the total number of bugs in these components. Output columns: bug_title, component_title, bugs_in_component, ordered by bugs_in_component (descending), then by bug_title (ascending).

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.bug
num int
title string

playground.component
id int
title string
playground.bug_component
bug_num int
component_id int

Your answer should include these columns:
bug_title varchar
component_title varchar
bugs_in_component integer
