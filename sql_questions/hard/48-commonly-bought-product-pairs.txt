48-***Find Top 3 Commonly Bought Product Pairs
 
Using the table playground.product_transactions, write a query to find the top 3 pairs of products that are most frequently bought together in the same transaction from the table playground.product_transactions. For this analysis, consider a pair to consist of two different products purchased in the same transaction. The output should list the pairs of products and the frequency of each pair (product1, product2, freq), ordered by product1 in ascending order, product2 in ascending order and frequency in descending order.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.product_transactions
transaction_id int
product_name string

Your answer should include these columns:
product1 varchar
product2 varchar
