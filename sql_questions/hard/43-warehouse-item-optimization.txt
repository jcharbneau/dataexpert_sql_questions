43-***Optimizing Stock of Prime and Non-Prime Items in a Warehouse
 
Given a warehouse with a capacity of 500,000 square feet, Amazon wishes to optimize the number of items stocked, prioritizing prime items. The goal is to fill the warehouse with as many prime items as possible and then supplement the remaining space with non-prime items. However, there are new operational constraints: prime and non-prime items must be stocked in equal quantities, and there must always be non-prime items in stock. Assuming each item occupies the same amount of space, using the table playground.inventory, write a query to determine the maximum number of prime and non-prime items that can be accommodated in the warehouse. The output should list the item_type (prime_eligible or not_prime) followed by the maximum number of item_count that can be stocked, ensuring item counts are whole numbers and adhering to the given constraints and prime_eligible first.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.inventory
item_id int
item_type string
item_category string
square_footage double

Your answer should include these columns:
item_type varchar
item_count integer



-- SELECT * FROM playground.inventory LIMIT 100


with item_space_requirements as (

  select 
    avg(square_footage) as avg_space_per_item
  from playground.inventory
),
total_items_possible as (
  select
    floor((500000 /2 ) / avg_space_per_item) as max_items_per_type
  from
    item_space_requirements
)



select
  'prime_eligible' as item_type,
  max_items_per_type as item_count
from 
  total_items_possible
  
 union all
  
select
  'not_prime' as item_type,
  max_items_per_type as item_count
from
total_items_possible 




with item_counts as (
    select
        'prime_eligible' as item_type,
        floor((500000 / 2) / (select avg(square_footage) from playground.inventory where item_type = 'prime_eligible')) as item_count
    union all
    select
        'not_prime' as item_type,
        floor((500000 / 2) / (select avg(square_footage) from playground.inventory where item_type = 'not_prime'))
)
select item_type, item_count from item_counts;
