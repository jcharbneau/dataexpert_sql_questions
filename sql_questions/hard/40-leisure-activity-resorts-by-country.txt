40-***Summarizing Leisure Activity Resorts by Country
 
Given a table playground.country_activities with columns: id (unique identifier), country (name of the country), region (region within the country), leisure_activity_type (type of leisure activity), and number_of_places (number of resorts offering the activity). Construct a SQL query to aggregate this information into a new table structure. The resulting table should have columns for each country, with the counts of resorts offering each type of activity: adventure_park, golf, river_cruise, and kart_racing. Sort the result by country name in ascending order.
These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.country_activities
id int
country string
region string
leisure_activity_type string
number_of_places int

Your answer should include these columns:
country varchar
adventure_park integer
golf integer
river_cruise integer
kart_racing integer

  sum(case when leisure_activity_type = 'Golf' then number_of_places else 0 end) as golf, 
  sum(case when leisure_activity_type = 'River cruise' then number_of_places else 0 end) as river_cruise, 
  sum(case when leisure_activity_type = 'Kart racing' then number_of_places else 0 end) as kart_racing
  
from
