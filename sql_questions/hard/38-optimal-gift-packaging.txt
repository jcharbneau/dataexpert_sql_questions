38-***Determining Optimal Packaging for Christmas Gifts
 
Given two tables, playground.gifts and playground.packages, write a SQL query to match each gift to the smallest package it fits into based on dimensions. A gift fits in a package if its dimensions are less than or equal to those of the package. A package is considered smaller than another if its volume is smaller. Each package can hold only one gift. Produce a table with columns: package_type and number, where number indicates how many gifts are matched to each package_type. Exclude package types not used. Sort the result by package_type in ascending order. Assume every gift fits in at least one package and no two packages have the same volume.

These are the tables to query for this question:
playground.gifts
id int
gift_name string
length int
width int
height int

playground.packages
package_type string
length int
width int
height int

Your answer should include these columns:
package_type varchar
number integer

solution

-- SELECT * FROM playground.gifts LIMIT 100
-- SELECT * FROM playground.packages LIMIT 100

-- get the sizes and volumes for gifts
with gift_volumes as (
  select
    id,
    gift_name,
    length * width * height as volume,
    length,
    width,
    height
  from
    playground.gifts
),
-- get the sizes and volumes for packages
package_volumes as (
  select 
    package_type,
    length * width * height as volume,
    length,
    width,
    height
  from
    playground.packages
),
gift_package_matches as (

  select
    g.id as gift_id,
    p.package_type,
    row_number() over(partition by g.id order by p.volume asc) as rank
  from
    gift_volumes g
    join package_volumes p on g.length <= p.length 
      and g.height <= p.height
)

select
  package_type,
  count(gift_id) as number
from
  gift_package_matches
where
  rank = 1
group by
  package_type
order by
  package_type asc

-- steps to construct

step 1
get the volumes
// get the sizes and volumes for gifts
select
  id,
  gift_name,
  length * width * height as volume,
  length,
  width,
  height
from
  playground.gifts
  
  
select 
  package_type,
  length * width * height as volume,
  length,
  width,
  height
from
  playground.packages


step 2
convert to cte's, and build a new query to get the matches
