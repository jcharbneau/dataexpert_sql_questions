44-***Check Second Sale Brand Preference Match
 
Using the tables playground.users, playground.items, and playground.orders, write a SQL query to determine for each user, whether the brand of the second item they sold matches their preferred brand. The output should include two columns: seller_id and has_pref_brand, where has_pref_brand is "yes" if the brand of the second item sold matches the users preferred brand, and "no" otherwise. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer for that user as "no". It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on the same day. The result should be ordered by user_id in ascending order.

These are the tables to query for this question:

playground.users
user_id int
join_date date
preferred_brand string

playground.items
item_id int
item_brand string

playground.orders
order_id int
order_date date
item_id int
buyer_id int
seller_id int

Your answer should include these columns:
seller_id integer
has_pref_brand varchar
